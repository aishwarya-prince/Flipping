Flipping Tile game, it's also know as memory game
It's called that because the main skill in this game is - how well user can remember the position of tiles.

Code written follows the following game methodlogy
1. The game consists of an even number of tiles with Alphabet on one side and a plain back. Each alphabet appears on precisely two tiles.
2. When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down.
3. The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. If the two tiles have the same alphabet, they remain face up. Otherwise, the tiles flip back over after a small period of time.
4. The goal of the game is to get all the tiles flipped face up (i.e., find all the matching alphabet pairs)
